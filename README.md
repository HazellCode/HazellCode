### Henlo ðŸ‘‹ (they/them)

I program stuff.

I'm currently in my third year of studying BSc in Audio and Music Technology at ARU.
But I'm looking towards a Career in Cyber Security / Pen Testing after untaking relevant certifications.

I'ev mostly only got Python and MATLAB (uni) stuff on here atm but that will change as the year goes on.

Bye
